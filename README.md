<b>What is a Chatbot? How to Deploy a Chatbot?<b/>
A Chatbot is a computer program which is programmed to interact with a human. A chatbot is designed to reply to a human user based on their queries and conversations. If you think chatbots are a new technology, you’re wrong. The first chatbot, Eliza, was built in 1966 at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum to mimic human conversations.

Now, before we build and deploy a chatbot, you should know what the chatterbot library is, as I will use this library for building our chatbot.

What is the Chatterbot Library in Python?
Chatterbot is a Python library that generates responses for users. It uses a lot of pre-trained machine learning algorithms to give a variety of responses. It’s easy to create chatbots using the chatterbot library in Python. The chatbot should be designed to be language-independent. He must be trained in several languages. The chatbot is made up of data provided by the user.

I will not cover the basics of Chatterbot here. If you want to learn the basics of this package you can learn it from here.

<b>How to Deploy a Chatbot?<b>
In python, we have Flask, which is useful in the tasks of web development of any program. In one of my previous articles, I deployed a Machine Learning model using flask, I will use the same method to deploy a chatbot.

As I am going to deploy chatbot as a web application, so it is not possible to deploy it without the use of HTML and CSS as these two are the primary packages when it comes to the tasks of web development. So, I will recommend you to learn HTML and CSS also if you are planning to work as a developer.

Now, let’s code to build and deploy a chatbot. I will start with the HTML and CSS part, as it will work as the base of our chatbot, without the base we cannot start with the project.
